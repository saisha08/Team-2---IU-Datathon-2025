# Team-2: IU Datathon 2025
Members: Saisha Siram, Adit Syed, Mark Vinokur


### Challenge Overview
This project was developed with the goal of utilizing machine learning to identify antisemitic content and hate speech in online platforms. Across a 3-part workshop series, our team learned how to scrape and annotate real-world data and train and evaluate an ML model.

**Challenge 1: Building and Annotating a Dataset**
The first challenge focused on data collection, sampling, and annotation:

Data Collection: Scraped over 100 posts from X (formerly Twitter) using Bright Data, targeting content potentially related to antisemitism.
Sampling & Documentation: Defined scraping strategies (e.g., keywords, user groups), documented motivations, and ensured inclusion of both antisemitic and non-antisemitic examples.
Annotation: Applied a consistent definition of antisemitism using a standardized annotation scheme or custom form, optionally using the provided Annotation Portal.

<u>Deliverables included:<u>
*Challenge 1 Report + Bonus
*Scraped posts from Twitter
*Annotated dataset from 2 different members
*Example code for data filtering

**Challenge 2: Model Development & Evaluation**
The second challenge focused on training and evaluating transformer-based classifiers:

Dataset Access: Used a pre-annotated gold-standard dataset to train models.
Modeling: Fine-tuned pre-trained models (Twitter-Roberta-Base-Offensive)
Evaluation: Assessed models using standard classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix)

<u>Deliverables included:<u>
*Challenge 2 Report + Bonus
*Example code for fine-tuning and testing
